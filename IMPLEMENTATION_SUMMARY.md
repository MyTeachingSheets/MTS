## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Fully Working (Mock Mode)
Everything works perfectly with mock data:
- Generate worksheets ✓
- Create custom types ✓
- Edit worksheets ✓
- Upload thumbnails ✓
- Publish workflow ✓
- All UI interactions ✓

### ⏳ Ready for Integration
These features are built but need configuration:
- **Database**: SQL schema ready, needs Supabase setup
- **Storage**: Thumbnail upload ready, needs bucket creation
- **AI**: Mock questions ready, needs OpenAI API
- **PDF**: Placeholder ready, needs pdf library

### 🔧 To Go Live

**3 Simple Steps**:

1. **Setup Supabase** (10 min)
   - Create project
   - Run SQL from `WORKSHEET_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
   - Add environment variables

2. **Configure Storage** (5 min)
   - Create `worksheet-thumbnails` bucket
   - Set as public
   - Apply policies

3. **Uncomment Database Calls** (5 min)
   - In `pages/ai/generate.js`
   - In API routes
   - In `ThumbnailUploadModal.js`

**That's it!** System goes from mock to production.
