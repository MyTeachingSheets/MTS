# ‚úÖ Switched to OpenAI Responses API

## What Changed

Your worksheet generation now uses **OpenAI's Responses API** instead of Chat Completions. This means:

‚úÖ **All requests appear in OpenAI Dashboard** under Logs/Responses  
‚úÖ **Proper logging with metadata** (subject, grade, worksheet type)  
‚úÖ **Uses your prompt configuration** from OpenAI dashboard  
‚úÖ **Better tracking** with response IDs  
‚úÖ **User attribution** for filtering logs  

---

## Benefits

### Before (Chat Completions):
- ‚ùå Requests didn't appear in dashboard (store: true was ignored)
- ‚ùå Had to manually copy model settings to database
- ‚ùå No metadata filtering in OpenAI logs
- ‚ùå Hard to track which generations used which prompts

### After (Responses API):
- ‚úÖ Every request logged in OpenAI Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Filter by subject, grade, worksheet type in dashboard
- ‚úÖ See exact prompt used for each generation
- ‚úÖ Track response IDs for debugging
- ‚úÖ User attribution (if you set x-user-id header)

---

## How It Works Now

### 1. With Prompt ID (Your Setup)
```javascript
// Your OpenAI prompt configuration is used automatically
const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: 'gpt-5',  // From your database (fallback)
  input: [
    { role: 'system', content: yourPromptContent },
    { role: 'user', content: worksheetRequest }
  ],
  store: true,  // ‚Üê This makes it appear in dashboard!
  metadata: {
    prompt_id: 'pmpt_68ea03da...',
    subject: 'Science',
    grade: '6',
    worksheetType: 'Quiz'
  }
})
```

### 2. In OpenAI Dashboard
You'll now see:
- **Response ID**: `resp_abc123...`
- **Metadata**: Subject, Grade, Type
- **Full conversation**: System + User messages
- **Model used**: gpt-5 (or whatever you configured)
- **Tokens**: Input + Output counts

---

## Setup Steps (If Starting Fresh)

### 1. Update Database Model
```sql
UPDATE public.prompt_templates
SET 
  model = 'gpt-5',  -- Or 'gpt-4.1-nano' or whatever your OpenAI prompt uses
  temperature = 1.00,
  max_tokens = 2048,
  response_format = 'json_object'
WHERE name = 'default';
```

### 2. Verify Your Prompt ID is Set
```sql
SELECT name, prompt_id, model FROM public.prompt_templates WHERE name = 'default';
```

Should show:
```
name: default
prompt_id: pmpt_68ea03da55e08196900fac4e660936950b42e6d351ad74ac
model: gpt-5
```

### 3. Test Generation
1. Generate a worksheet at `/ai/generate`
2. Check your logs:
   ```
   Using OpenAI Responses API with prompt ID: pmpt_68ea03da...
   Model: gpt-5, Temperature: 1.00, Max Output Tokens: 2048
   Response ID: resp_abc123... | Tokens: 1234
   ```

### 4. Check OpenAI Dashboard
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/logs
2. Click **Responses** tab
3. You should see your request with:
   - Response ID
   - Metadata (subject, grade, type)
   - Full conversation
   - Model and tokens used

---

## Metadata Available for Filtering

Every request now includes:
```javascript
{
  prompt_id: 'pmpt_68ea03da...',  // Your OpenAI prompt ID
  subject: 'Science',
  grade: '6',
  worksheetType: 'Quiz',
  framework: 'Common Core',        // If selected
  lesson: 'Photosynthesis'        // If selected
}
```

You can filter dashboard logs by any of these fields!

---

## Optional: User Attribution

To track which user generated which worksheet, pass a header:

```javascript
// In your frontend
fetch('/api/ai/generate', {
  headers: {
    'x-user-id': 'teacher_123'  // User ID or email
  }
})
```

This will show up in the OpenAI dashboard as the "user" field.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Responses not appearing in dashboard"
1. Check you're using a **Project API Key** (not organization key)
2. Verify you're viewing the correct project in dashboard
3. Ensure data retention is enabled in project settings
4. Wait a few seconds - logs can take time to appear

### "Model not matching my prompt"
The database `model` field is a **fallback**. If your OpenAI prompt has a specific model configured, that takes precedence.

### "Want to use different model"
Update your database OR update your OpenAI prompt configuration in the dashboard.
