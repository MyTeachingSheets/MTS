# Simple Next.js One-Page Site

This is a minimal Next.js starter for a one-page website. It includes a simple hero section and contact anchor.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Deployment and domain

- To deploy, you can use Vercel (recommended for Next.js). After deploying, point your Namecheap domain to the Vercel project using their domain settings.
- Alternatively, deploy to any host that supports Node.js and configure your domain's DNS to point to the host.

Next steps

- Add meta tags and SEO
- Replace placeholder email and content
- Add analytics and contact form
- (Optional) integrate Tailwind CSS for faster styling

Logging

This project includes a logging API at `pages/api/logs.js`. By default the API now writes to Supabase (recommended for persistent storage).

Setup (Supabase):

- Create a Supabase project and in the SQL editor run:

```sql
create table logs (
	id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
	level text,
	message text,
	meta jsonb,
	ts timestamptz default now()
);
```

- Set these environment variables (server-only) in your deployment platform or `.env` during local dev:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
LOG_ADMIN_TOKEN=some-long-random-secret
```

- POST `/api/logs` with JSON { level, message, meta } to insert a log row.
- GET `/api/logs` returns the latest logs and is protected by `LOG_ADMIN_TOKEN` (passed via header `x-admin-token` or via the admin cookie set by `/api/admin-login`).

Security notes:

- Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `LOG_ADMIN_TOKEN` secret (use Vercel/GitHub Secrets).
- The admin page `/admin/logs` now uses server-side rendering to avoid exposing secrets to the browser. For stronger controls, use Row Level Security (RLS) and a restricted insert function rather than the service role key.
