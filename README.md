# Simple Next.js One-Page Site

This is a minimal Next.js starter for a one-page website. It includes a simple hero section and contact anchor.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Deployment and domain

- To deploy, you can use Vercel (recommended for Next.js). After deploying, point your Namecheap domain to the Vercel project using their domain settings.
- Alternatively, deploy to any host that supports Node.js and configure your domain's DNS to point to the host.

Next steps

- Add meta tags and SEO
- Replace placeholder email and content
- Add analytics and contact form
- (Optional) integrate Tailwind CSS for faster styling
